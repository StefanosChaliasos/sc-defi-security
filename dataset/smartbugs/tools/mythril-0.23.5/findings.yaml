Jump to an arbitrary instruction:
    method: Search for jumps to arbitrary locations in the bytecode
    classification: SWC-127
    severity: high
    descr_short: The caller can redirect execution to arbitrary bytecode locations.
    descr_long: It is possible to redirect the control flow to arbitrary locations in the code. This may allow an attacker to bypass security controls or manipulate the business logic of the smart contract. Avoid using low-level-operations and assembly to prevent this issue.

Write to an arbitrary storage location:
    method: Search for any writes to an arbitrary storage slot
    classification: SWC-124
    severity: high
    descr_short: The caller can write to arbitrary storage locations.
    descr_long: It is possible to write to arbitrary storage locations. By modifying the values of storage variables, attackers may bypass security controls or manipulate the business logic of the smart contract.

Delegatecall to user-supplied address:
    classification: SWC-112
    method: Check for invocations of delegatecall to a user-supplied address.
    descr_short: The contract delegates execution to another contract with a user-supplied address.
    descr_long: The smart contract delegates execution to a user-supplied address. This could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the context of this contract account and manipulate the state of the contract account or execute actions on its behalf.
    severity: high

Dependence on tx.origin:
    classification: SWC-115
    method: Check whether control flow decisions are influenced by tx.origin
    descr_long: The tx.origin environment variable has been found to influence a control flow decision. Note that using tx.origin as a security control might cause a situation where a user inadvertently authorizes a smart contract to perform an action on their behalf. It is recommended to use msg.sender instead.
    severity: low
    descr_short: Use of tx.origin as a part of authorization control.

Dependence on predictable environment variable:
    classification: SWC-116 if the control flow depends on block.timestamp, and SWC-120 otherwise
    method: Check whether control flow decisions are influenced by block.coinbase, block.gaslimit, block.timestamp or block.number.
    descr_short: A control flow decision is made based on the block variable coinbase, gaslimit, timestamp or block number.
    descr_long: One or more of block.coinbase, block.gaslimit, block.timestamp or block.number are used to determine a control flow decision. Note that the values of these variables are predictable and can be manipulated by a malicious miner. Also keep in mind that attackers know hashes of earlier blocks. Don't use any of those environment variables as sources of randomness and be aware that use of these variables introduces a certain level of trust into miners.
    severity: low

Unprotected Ether Withdrawal:
    method: Search for cases where Ether can be withdrawn to a user-specified address.  An issue is reported if there is a valid end state where the attacker has successfully increased their Ether balance.
    classification: SWC-105
    severity: high
    descr_short: Any sender can withdraw Ether from the contract account.
    descr_long: Arbitrary senders other than the contract creator can profitably extract Ether from the contract account. Verify the business logic carefully and make sure that appropriate security controls are in place to prevent unexpected loss of funds.

Exception State:
    classification: SWC-110
    method: Checks whether any exception states are reachable.
    descr_long: It is possible to trigger an assertion violation. Note that Solidity assert() statements should only be used to check invariants. Review the transaction trace generated for this issue and either make sure your program logic is correct, or use require() instead of assert() if your goal is to constrain user inputs or enforce preconditions. Remember to validate inputs from both callers (for instance, via passed arguments) and callees (for instance, via return values).
    severity: medium
    descr_short: An assertion violation was triggered.

External Call To User-Supplied Address:
    method: Search for external calls with unrestricted gas to a user-specified address.
    classification: SWC-107
    descr_short: A call to a user-supplied address is executed.
    descr_long: An external message call to an address specified by the caller is executed. Note that the callee account might contain arbitrary code and could re-enter any function within this contract. Reentering the contract in an intermediate state may lead to unexpected behaviour. Make sure that no state modifications are executed after this call and/or reentrancy guards are in place.
    severity: low

Integer Arithmetic Bugs:
    classification: SWC-101
    method: For every SUB instruction, check if there is a possible state where the second operand is larger than the first one. For every ADD, MUL instruction, check if there is a possible state where the result of the operation overflows.
    descr_short: The arithmetic operator can underflow/overflow
    descr_long: It is possible to cause an integer overflow or underflow in the arithmetic operation. Prevent this by constraining inputs using the require() statement or use the OpenZeppelin SafeMath library for integer arithmetic operations. Refer to the transaction trace generated for this issue to reproduce the issue.
    severity: high

Multiple Calls in a Single Transaction:
    classification: SWC-113
    method: Check for multiple sends in a single transaction
    descr_long: This call is executed following another call within the same transaction. It is possible that the call never gets executed if a prior call fails permanently. This might be caused intentionally by a malicious callee. If possible, refactor the code such that each transaction only executes one external call or make sure that all callees can be trusted (i.e. theyâ€™re part of your own codebase).
    severity: low
    descr_short: Multiple calls are executed in the same transaction.

State access after external call:
    method: Check whether the account state is accesses after the execution of an external call
    severity: medium if user defined address, low if fixed address
    descr_short: Read of/Write to persistent state following external call
    descr_long: The contract account state is accessed after an external call to a user-defined/fixed address. To prevent reentrancy issues, consider accessing the state only before the call, especially if the callee is untrusted. Alternatively, a reentrancy lock can be used to prevent untrusted callees from re-entering the contract in an intermediate state.
    classification: SWC-107

Unprotected Selfdestruct:
    method: Check if the contact can be 'accidentally' killed by anyone. For kill-able contracts, also check whether it is possible to direct the contract balance to the attacker.
    classification: SWC-106
    descr_short: Any sender can cause the contract to self-destruct.
    descr_long: Any sender can trigger execution of the SELFDESTRUCT instruction to destroy this contract account. Review the transaction trace generated for this issue and make sure that appropriate security controls are in place to prevent unrestricted access.
    severity: high

Unchecked return value from external call.:
    classification: SWC-104
    method: Test whether CALL return value is checked. For direct calls, the Solidity compiler auto-generates this check. For low-level-calls this check is omitted.
    descr_long: External calls return a boolean value. If the callee halts with an exception, 'false' is returned and execution continues in the caller. The caller should check whether an exception happened and react accordingly to avoid unexpected behavior. For example it is often desirable to wrap external calls in require() so the transaction is reverted if the call fails.
    severity: medium
    descr_short: The return value of a message call is not checked.
